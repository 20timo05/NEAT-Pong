# Motivation
Recently, I have developed a [Native implementation of the Algorithm NEAT](https://github.com/20timo05/NEAT-from-Scratch) and wanted to put it to the test. I chose a fairly simple Game called PONG for this purpose.

# How to run the project
There are different ways to run the project.
* `train.py` lets you train your own AI while having a look at the training stats in the console. The AI will be saved to disk.
* `singlePlayer.py` will let you play against either the pretrained AI by me, or your own created with `train.py`.
* `multiplayer.py` enables two users to play against each other. This has nothing to do with the AI itself, but was used in the earlier stages of development.
